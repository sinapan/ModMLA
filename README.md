# ModMLA (Modular Machine Learning Architecture)
This projects aims to demonstrate a [modular programing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming) approach to machine learning and data analysis projects. A typical data analysis can be broken down to three steps of preprocessing, modeling and driving conclusions where multiple methods exist for each step. A modular code architecture allows the developer/scientis to quickly jump between different processing methodologies (i.e. NN vs. SVM for processing your data) which can result in quicker design cycle.
## Getting Started
It is better if you have some familiarity with machine learning techniques. We will not be covering any theory regarding machine learning rather focus on the code's architecture. You can find great machine learning tutorials and examples on .. .  These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
